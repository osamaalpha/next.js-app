Wowder will: cut shine, blur the appearance of pores, set makeup, look like skin. Wowder won’t: leave a chalky film, cake into fine lines, flatten skin’s texture, or announce its presence in photographs (no camera flashback). In three sheer, glowy, adaptable shades...because no skin tone is HD-white. Pair with the angelically soft Wowder Brush for all-over and targeted application—perfect size, perfect shape, perfect density for the optimal matte-not-flat finish.","rating":null,"category":"powder","product_type":"foundation","tag_list":[],"created_at":"2017-12-27T02:50:48.250Z","updated_at":"2017-12-27T02:53:24.450Z","product_api_url":"http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products/1002.json","api_featured_image":"//s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/001/002/original/open-uri20171227-4-1ne7r73?1514343097","product_colors":[{"hex_value":"#EABC98","colour_name":"Light/Medium"},{"hex_value":"#9B674E","colour_name":"Dark/Deep"},{"hex_value":"#714831","colour_name":"Rich"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
