The pillowy, gel-cream formula is designed to be the most user-friendly cheek color in existence. If you can finger paint, you can Cloud Paint—simply dab it onto cheeks wherever you please. It’s seamless, sheer, and buildable (i.e. it’s hard to accidentally apply too much). Inspired by gradient pink NYC sunsets, the shades are optimized to work across a wide range of skin tones for a healthy, flushed-from-within glow.","rating":null,"category":"cream","product_type":"blush","tag_list":[],"created_at":"2017-12-27T03:04:32.907Z","updated_at":"2017-12-27T03:05:09.354Z","product_api_url":"http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products/1003.json","api_featured_image":"//s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/001/003/original/open-uri20171227-4-13ivnwv?1514343870","product_colors":[{"hex_value":"#C78B7C","colour_name":"Dusk"},{"hex_value":"#F3D1E0","colour_name":"Puff"},{"hex_value":"#F1BB9E","colour_name":"Beam"},{"hex_value":"#B65F79","colour_name":"Haze"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
