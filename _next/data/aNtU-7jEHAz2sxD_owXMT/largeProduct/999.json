We’ve created a short list of the six most important shades, with dialed-down pigment loads for a casual look: Zip, Leo, Crush, and Jam, along with the super subtle Cake and Like, which give some oomph to lighter lip tones. They’re lipsticks that adapt to you, not the other way around, so they'll appear a bit different on everyone as your natural lip color shows through. The effect? Diffused, matte goodness—just swipe it on.","rating":null,"category":null,"product_type":"lipstick","tag_list":[],"created_at":"2017-12-27T02:21:55.363Z","updated_at":"2017-12-27T02:55:18.719Z","product_api_url":"http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products/999.json","api_featured_image":"//s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/000/999/original/open-uri20171227-4-2ul0s6?1514341420","product_colors":[{"hex_value":"#F4E1D7","colour_name":"Cake"},{"hex_value":"#E5C2CF","colour_name":"Like"},{"hex_value":"#CB6382","colour_name":"Crush"},{"hex_value":"#974A72","colour_name":"Jam"},{"hex_value":"#A46C58","colour_name":"Leo"},{"hex_value":"#DE6262","colour_name":"Zip"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
