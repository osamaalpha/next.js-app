The satin matte shadows can be used as a liner, on the lid, and in the crease of the eye for an expertly contoured and blended look. How To Use: Apply dry all over the eyelid with a brush for a subtle wash of colour or apply wet for a vibrant effect.  Start with a light color and apply the shade all over your eyelid as a base.  Next, apply a medium shade over the eyelid and the eye crease using the crease brush.  Finally, apply the darkest shade over your eyelid.
