The problem is, they were hauling tons of different eye liners to every shoot. This waterproof liquid liner is designed to do it all. The precision tip pen gives you a smooth, controlled application every time. You can easily draw a thin or thick line in 1 sweep. Grab your own and start smoldering!For a fine line, use just the tip of the pen. Hold pen with the tip pointing at the eye lid and gently glide from inner to outer corner of eye. For a thicker line, lay the pen on its side and gently gliding along lashline from inner to outer corner of the eye. The more pressure applied, the thicker the line you will achieve.
