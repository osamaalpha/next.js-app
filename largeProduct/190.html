A truly next-level eyeliner, it gets its richness from a black base that blasts the luminosity, creating a shiny, shimmery special effect that lights up your eyes. Blackened jewel tones with a foil finish, these can be used for lining or a full-on lid look. And there are two great ways to play these blendable beauties: For a “classic cat” look, extend the color just past the lashline. For a “smoldering smoky” vibe, gently blend upward from the lashline to the crease. Available in four chic shades - Black Gold Foil, Brown Foil, Purple Foil and Navy Foil – with a custom pro brush that deposits color exactly where you want it.
