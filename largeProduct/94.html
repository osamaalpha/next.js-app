cheeks and lips, for a natural, monochromatic look.  The velvety, 
ultra-light texture blends flawlessly onto the skin for an “airbrushed” 
finish.  Cheeks appear smooth and flawless.  The cream-to-powder formula
 sets for an exceptionally longwearing finish and never settles into 
fine lines.  The dial-up stick makes application a breeze.
Available in 5 shades:  Santorini, Key West and Maui give a natural and 
pretty colour to the cheeks, eyes and lips.  St. Tropez offers sheer 
bronze glow perfect for giving a soft tan glow or sculpting the 
cheekbones.  Champagne is a warm highlighter that is ideal for 
highlighting key areas of the face.
