powder.  Gently stipple the minerals on your eye lids.   Make sure your 
skin is well hydrated so the minerals will adhere.  Try misting your 
skin with Pure Anada Marine Mineral Toner, prior to applying your 
makeup.If your shadow is prone to creasing, make sure your lids are free 
from excess oils before applying shadow.  If the problem is persistant, 
try priming your lids with Pure Anada Matte Minerals Finishing Powder or
 a coordinating Velvet Matte Shadow.
Deep shades of loose mineral shadow can be used as eyeliner.  To 
create a soft dry line, dip an angled liner brush into the powder, tap 
it off and line your eyes.  Or to create a liquid liner, wet your brush 
and dip it into the powder.  The minerals will stick to the brush.  Make
 a paste on the back of your hand, or in the lid of the jar.  Apply to 
your eyes!Ingredients: Mica,  Iron Oxides, Ultramarines, May contain: Titanium Dioxide</p><img src="https://d3t32hsnjxo7q6.cloudfront.net/i/4daf84bee451c265ec04f7cc1b8bb7c3_ra,w158,h184_pa,w158,h184.jpeg"/><button>Add to Cart</button></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"product":{"id":281,"brand":"pure anada","name":"Pure Anada Loose Luminous Eye Colour ","price":"8.0","price_sign":null,"currency":null,"image_link":"https://d3t32hsnjxo7q6.cloudfront.net/i/4daf84bee451c265ec04f7cc1b8bb7c3_ra,w158,h184_pa,w158,h184.jpeg","product_link":"https://well.ca/products/pure-anada-loose-luminous-eye-colour_93638.html","website_link":"https://well.ca","description":"Pure Anada Loose Luminous Eye Colours are made with finely milled micas that impart an illuminating glow.  Apply them dry for soft, subtle color, or wet for more vibrant intensity.  Learn how you can use your favourite shade to make customized lip balm with our easy DIY Lip Balm recipe on our blog, The Well!About Shade Tones: Warm Shades (W) if you have yellow undertones in your skinCool Shades (C) if you have blue undertones in your skinNeutral Shades (N) to accent any skin tone or eye colorApplication Tips: Dip your shadow brush into the loose minerals and tap off any excess \npowder.  Gently stipple the minerals on your eye lids.   Make sure your \nskin is well hydrated so the minerals will adhere.  Try misting your \nskin with Pure Anada Marine Mineral Toner, prior to applying your \nmakeup.If your shadow is prone to creasing, make sure your lids are free \nfrom excess oils before applying shadow.  If the problem is persistant, \ntry priming your lids with Pure Anada Matte Minerals Finishing Powder or\n a coordinating Velvet Matte Shadow.\nDeep shades of loose mineral shadow can be used as eyeliner.  To \ncreate a soft dry line, dip an angled liner brush into the powder, tap \nit off and line your eyes.  Or to create a liquid liner, wet your brush \nand dip it into the powder.  The minerals will stick to the brush.  Make\n a paste on the back of your hand, or in the lid of the jar.  Apply to \nyour eyes!Ingredients: Mica,  Iron Oxides, Ultramarines, May contain: Titanium Dioxide","rating":4.5,"category":null,"product_type":"eyeshadow","tag_list":["Canadian","Natural"],"created_at":"2016-10-01T18:30:13.373Z","updated_at":"2017-12-23T21:08:13.317Z","product_api_url":"http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products/281.json","api_featured_image":"//s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/000/281/original/data?1514063293","product_colors":[{"hex_value":"#373030","colour_name":"Black Tie (N) "},{"hex_value":"#D7AE7A","colour_name":"Champagne (N) "},{"hex_value":"#865945","colour_name":"Close to Cocoa (W) "},{"hex_value":"#702A1A","colour_name":"Copper (W) "},{"hex_value":"#6D8B93","colour_name":"Cornflower (N) "},{"hex_value":"#4E3E3E","colour_name":"Deep Plum (N) "},{"hex_value":"#377A3C","colour_name":"Grenada Green (N) "},{"hex_value":"#A5A1A2","colour_name":"Lavender Grey (C) "},{"hex_value":"#C24152","colour_name":"Marsala "},{"hex_value":"#656D78","colour_name":"Moonstone (C) "},{"hex_value":"#274A65","colour_name":"Ocean Mist (C) "},{"hex_value":"#EBC8B4","colour_name":"Peach Freeze (N) "},{"hex_value":"#69577F","colour_name":"Purple Pride (C) "}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/largeProduct/[id]","query":{"id":"281"},"buildId":"8qbSEkI7Z1dNQz0pyk5HV","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
