Liquid Liner</p><p>9.99</p><p>Try CoverGirl Intensify Me! Liquid Liner and get the control of a pencil with the intensity of a liquid eyeliner for 
beautifully defined eyes every time. The all-new paddle-shaped tip gives
 you two looks in one—thick and dramatic or thin and elegant. The 
intense black formula glides on smoothly and dries quickly for instant 
drama. Clinically tested, suitable for sensitive eyes.Directions: Stand 6 inches away from a mirror and tilt your chin up, so 
that when you look down your nose into the mirror, you can see your 
entire eyelid. Dab concealer or dust translucent powder on your upper 
lids. Blend well with a sponge or lightly pat with a fingertip to cover 
veins and prevent creasing.Before applying liner, 
determine your eye shape. If eyes are close-set or round, line only the 
outer corners. Otherwise, line the entire upper lid.Gently pull your eyelid taut at an upward angle. Beginning at the inner 
corner, draw small, connected dashes along the top lashes. Be sure to 
stay close to the roots so there is no skin visible between the lashes 
and the liner. To make eyes look bigger, extend the liner slightly 
beyond the outer corners.Use a cotton swab to fix mistakes. For larger messes, dip it in makeup remover.</p><img src="https://d3t32hsnjxo7q6.cloudfront.net/i/28f0f546d02a7c4330b4d186d42e3c32_ra,w158,h184_pa,w158,h184.jpg"/><button>Add to Cart</button></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"product":{"id":220,"brand":"covergirl","name":"CoverGirl Intensify Me!
